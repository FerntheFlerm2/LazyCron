# An example script line is provided below:



#Time              Frequency     Date              Requirements         Script Path
2pm-8pm            1h            sat-sun           online, idle 5       msgbox "You could run an script on this line. Edit schedule.txt to delete this line and add your own programs"
*                  7s            *                 *                    msgbox "LazyCron is working! Edit schedule.txt to delete this line and add your own programs"



# Not sure if your schedule will work correctly? Run the program with the --testing option or just put a # before each script path to show what it would do and when.
