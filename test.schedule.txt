# A schedule for testing LazyCron.

# Example commands are below:
#Time            Frequency        Date                Requirements                  Script Path
*                    0               Thursday-Mon     random 60s                    # random
*                    1h              *                usage 6s             	        # elapsed		#tab test
*                    *               *                idle 5s                       # idle


#  This example skips first, runs once and never again:
*                    0               *                skip, reps 1                  # skip


# Thread test, make sure process finishes before starting new one
*                    4s              *                 *                            sleep 1m

# Timeout test
*                    *               *                timeout 10s, localdir         time sleep 1h
